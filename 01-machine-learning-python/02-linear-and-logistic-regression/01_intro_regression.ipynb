    "## ðŸŽ¯ What is Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression** is a type of **supervised learning** algorithm used to model the relationship between a **continuous target variable** (also called the dependent variable) and one or more **explanatory features** (independent variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to **predict continuous values**, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- COâ‚‚ emissions from car specifications\n",
    "- House prices based on features\n",
    "- Yearly income based on age, education, hours worked\n",
    "- Machine failure timing from sensor data\n",

    "## ðŸ”¢ Types of Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Description | Example |\n",
    "|------|-------------|---------|\n",
    "| **Simple Regression** | One independent variable is used to predict the target | Predict COâ‚‚ emission using only engine size |\n",
    "| **Multiple Regression** | More than one independent variable is used | Predict COâ‚‚ emission using engine size and number of cylinders |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“ˆ Linear vs Nonlinear Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Regression**: Predicts using a straight line (assumes a linear relationship)\n",
    "- **Nonlinear Regression**: Uses curves, polynomials, or other functions to fit more complex patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Both **simple** and **multiple** regression can be **linear or nonlinear** depending on the relationship between features and the target.\n",

    "| Domain | Use Case |\n",
    "|--------|----------|\n",
    "| **Finance** | Predict house prices, stock prices, or customer credit risk |\n",
    "| **Sales** | Forecast revenue or sales per salesperson |\n",
    "| **Healthcare** | Predict disease likelihood (e.g., diabetes risk) |\n",
    "| **Public Health** | Model spread of infectious diseases |\n",
    "| **Environmental Science** | Estimate rainfall, air quality, or wildfire risk |\n",
    "| **Manufacturing** | Predict machine maintenance needs |\n",

    "## âœ… Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regression estimates **continuous outcomes** using one or more input variables.\n",
    "- **Simple regression** uses one feature; **multiple regression** uses many.\n",
    "- Relationships can be **linear** or **nonlinear**.\n",
    "- Regression is widely used across **finance, health, environment, and industry**.\n",
    "- Tools like **Scikit-learn** make implementation efficient and accessible.\n",
