    "All algorithms used in deep learning are **inspired by how neurons in the human brain process data**. The key structure of a biological neuron includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Soma**: The main body that contains the **nucleus** (processing center).\n",
    "- **Dendrites**: Branching arms that receive electrical signals (input).\n",
    "- **Axon**: A long extension that sends signals (output).\n",
    "- **Synapses**: Terminal buttons at the end of the axon that connect to other neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üñº The earliest neuron drawing was made by **Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal** in 1899, based on a pigeon‚Äôs brain under a microscope. He is known as the *father of modern neuroscience*.\n",

    "1. **Dendrites** receive incoming signals (electrical impulses) from other neurons.\n",
    "2. Signals are passed to the **soma** where they are **processed**.\n",
    "3. The **axon** carries the processed signal away from the soma.\n",
    "4. **Synapses** transmit the signal to **other neurons**.\n",
