    "## Gradient Descent and Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we learned how gradient descent works by minimizing a cost (or loss) function to optimize weights in a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Concept Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- We start with a **cost function** (also called loss function), which measures how far off our model's predictions are from the actual target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the simplest case, with one input feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  z = w \\cdot x\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- And the **cost function** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(w) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left(z_i - w x_i \\right)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal is to find the **best value of \\( w \\)** that minimizes this cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìâ What is Gradient Descent?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gradient Descent** is an **iterative optimization algorithm** that:\n",
    "  - Starts with a **random initial value** of the weight \\( w_0 \\)\n",
    "  - Moves step-by-step in the direction of the **negative gradient**\n",
    "  - Continues updating \\( w \\) until the cost function reaches a **minimum**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìê Gradient Descent Update Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_{t+1} = w_t - \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{dJ}{dw}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( \\alpha \\) = learning rate  \n",
    "- \\( \\frac{dJ}{dw} \\) = gradient of the loss function at \\( w_t \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß™ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let‚Äôs say the true relation is \\( z = 2x \\)\n",
    "- Initial weight: \\( w_0 = 0 \\)\n",
    "- Learning rate: \\( \\alpha = 0.4 \\)\n",

    "### Iterations:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Iteration | \\( w \\) Value | Observation |\n",
    "|-----------|---------------|-------------|\n",
    "| 0         | 0.0           | Horizontal line, high cost |\n",
    "| 1         | Moves closer to 2 | Cost drops significantly |\n",
    "| 2         | Closer to 2 | Cost continues dropping |\n",
    "| 3         | Almost there | Smaller step due to flatter slope |\n",
    "| 4         | Nearly perfect fit | Converged near minimum |\n",

    "## ‚ö†Ô∏è Learning Rate Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Too large**: May overshoot and never converge (divergence)\n",
    "- **Too small**: May converge very slowly\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient Descent is essential for **learning in neural networks**\n",
    "- It updates weights in the **opposite direction of the gradient**\n",
    "- Learning rate controls **step size** and must be tuned carefully\n",
    "- With every iteration, the model gets **closer to the optimal weight values**\n",
